## HAProxy Data Plane API

**Data Plane API** is a sidecar process that runs next to HAProxy and provides API endpoints for managing HAProxy. It requires HAProxy version 1.9.0 or higher.

## Building the Data Plane API

In order to build the Data Plane API you need go 1.12 installed on your system with go modules support enabled, and execute the following steps:

1\. Clone dataplaneapi repository

```
git clone https://github.com/haproxytech/dataplaneapi.git
```

2\. Run make build:

```
make build
```

3\. You can find the built binary in /build directory.

## Running the Data Plane API
Basic usage:

API for editing and managing haproxy instances

Application Options:

      --tls-keep-alive=                            sets the TCP keep-alive timeouts on accepted connections. It prunes dead TCP connections ( e.g. closing laptop mid-download)
      --tls-read-timeout=                          maximum duration before timing out read of the request
      --tls-write-timeout=                         maximum duration before timing out write of the response

      --userlist-file=                             Path to the dataplaneapi userlist file. By default userlist is read from HAProxy conf. When specified userlist would be read from this file

## Example

You can test it by simply running:

```
./dataplaneapi --port 5555 -b /usr/sbin/haproxy -c /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg  -d 5 -r "service haproxy reload" -s "service haproxy restart" -u dataplaneapi -t /tmp/haproxy
```

Test it out with curl, note that you need user/pass combination setup in HAProxy userlist in haproxy configuration (in above example: /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg, userlist controller):

```
curl -u <user>:<pass> -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://127.0.0.1:5555/v1/"
```

If you are using secure passwords, supported algorithms are: md5, sha-256 and sha-512.

## Using the Data Plane API

For more docs how to use the Data Plane API check our [documentation](https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/hapee/1-9r1/configuration/dataplaneapi/)

Alternatively, dataplaneapi serves it's own interactive documentation relevant for the current build on the `/v1/docs` uri. Just point your browser to the host/port dataplane was started with (i.e. `http://localhost:5555/v1/docs`)
